#customize multi-load lock


Custom options can be set on the CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, and CompleteMultipartUpload operations executed by the multipart uploader via callbacks passed to its constructor.

$source = '/path/to/large/file.zip';
$uploader = new MultipartUploader($s3Client, $source, [
    'bucket' => 'your-bucket',
    'key'    => 'my-file.zip',
    'before_initiate' => function (\Aws\Command $command) {
        // $command is a CreateMultipartUpload operation
        $command['CacheControl'] = 'max-age=3600';
    },
    'before_upload' => function (\Aws\Command $command) {
       // $command is an UploadPart operation
       $command['RequestPayer'] = 'requester';
    },
    'before_complete' => function (\Aws\Command $command) {
       // $command is a CompleteMultipartUpload operation
       $command['RequestPayer'] = 'requester';
    },
]);
