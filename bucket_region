#AWS S3 multi-region clients maintain a cache of the regions in which given buckets reside. By default, each client has its own in-memory cache. To share a cache between clients or processes, supply an instance of Aws\CacheInterface as the bucket_region_cache option to your multi-region client.

use Aws\DoctrineCacheAdapter;
use Aws\Sdk;
use Doctrine\Common\Cache\ApcuCache;

$sdk = new Aws\Sdk([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region' => 'us-west-2',
    'S3' => [
        'bucket_region_cache' => new DoctrineCacheAdapter(new ApcuCache),
    ],
]);
